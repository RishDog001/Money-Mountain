# Money Mountain
Our capstone project is a quiz game with a built-in money transfer application. This project uses Windows Forms (C#) and MySQL (MySQL server) for the database. The questions are based on random topics, each in a separate form. The first question starts at $100 and increments each time the user answers the question correctly (Q2 - $200, Q3 - $300, Q4 - $500, etc.). But if the participant gets a question wrong, the game automatically ends, and if they get any of the 1st five questions wrong, they leave empty-handed. If they guess any of the following five questions incorrectly (6-10), they only get $1000. After the 10th question, the participant walks away with only $32,000 if they guess the wrong answer to any of the remaining questions.

The form controls are as follows: 
•	Four radio buttons representing each answer choice.
•	Two buttons representing lifelines in case the user gets stuck on a question and two more buttons (1 button gets enabled when the user answers a question correctly. Once clicked, it navigates to the next question. The other button lets the user quit the game if they don’t know the answer to a question and uses up both lifelines – note that the quit button only gets enabled if at least one of the two lifeline buttons becomes disabled).
•	Two labels: 1 to display the question on the form and the other to display the timer on the screen.
•	Timer: The 1st five questions will have a timer counting down from 45 seconds, and then the following five questions will have a timer counting down from 60 seconds (if the user fails to answer any question within the time limit, they automatically get disqualified). 
•	Message box (aka pop-up alert) to display confirmation/status messages and validation error messages for the login/registration page leading to the money transfer page.

If the user quits the game or if the game ends because of an incorrect answer, the program will switch to the login/register page, where the user enters their information, such as their name, email, and password (you only need to enter your username and password for the login part). Once the inputs are validated and the login/registration information is stored in the database, a button will appear, which takes the user to the money transfer page, where we input the account number, transfer amount, username, and password. All user information from the login/register page is securely stored inside a MySQL database using Argon2 as the hashing algorithm (We used PhpMyAdmin as our MySQL server client). We also used/integrated a PayPal API for the transfer funds page to handle real transactions.

To gain access to PhpMyAdmin, you first need to install XAMPP. Once you have it installed, you can follow these instructions to set up the database functionality: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/connect-mysql-with-c-sharp-net-framework-in-visual-studio-2019/ (Note that these instructions will work for the 2019 and later versions as well).
